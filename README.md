# 🖥️ Virtual Memory Simulator

**Duration:** Sep 2024 – Sep 2024  
**Domain:** Computer Systems • Memory Management  

---

## 📖 Overview
The **Virtual Memory Simulator** models how modern operating systems manage memory using paging.  
It demonstrates the process of:
- Translating **virtual addresses** to **physical addresses**.
- Walking through a **5-level page table lookup**.
- Handling **page faults**.
- Simulating **real-world memory management behavior**.

This project serves as an educational tool to understand the fundamentals of **virtual memory management** and **address translation**.

## 🚀 Features
- 📑 **Page Table Simulation**: Implements a 5-level hierarchical page table.  
- ⚡ **Address Translation**: Converts virtual addresses into corresponding physical addresses.  
- ❌ **Page Fault Handling**: Simulates faults when a page is not present in memory.  
- 🔄 **Replacement Policies (Optional)**: Can be extended to include FIFO / LRU for page replacement.  
- 🧩 **Educational Utility**: Helps visualize how operating systems manage memory.
